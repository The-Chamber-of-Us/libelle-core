# 📚 Context Briefs

Welcome to the **Context Briefs** library for Libelle!  
This is where we capture **living knowledge** — the *why* and *how* behind decisions, experiments, and practices at TCUS.  

Think of these as **mini field notes**: part history, part guide, part experiment log.  
They are *not* meeting minutes, *not* PRDs — they’re snapshots of learning that help us and future contributors understand **why we work the way we do**.  

---

## ✨ What Goes Here
- Short documents (1–2 pages) that explain **context** around a decision or practice.  
- Examples:  
  - Why we added a **private sandbox repo** for developers.  
  - How HCI principles apply to **CR-002 (Index Page Experiment)**.  
  - Lessons from a sprint retrospective worth carrying forward.

## 🛠 How to Add a Brief
1. Create a new file in this folder.  
2. Use the format:

Example:  
`2025-09-05-private-sandbox-repo.md`  

3. At the top of your file, include:
- **Title**  
- **Date**  
- **Author**  
- **Related Artifacts** (links to PRDs, GitHub repos, etc.)  

4. Write your brief in sections (suggested):  
- **The Why** (problem or context)  
- **The What** (decision or idea)  
- **The How** (process, workflow, or implementation)  
- **What’s Next** (open questions, next steps)

## 🎨 Style & Tone
- Be clear, but keep it human.  
- Use lists, headings, and even emojis if they help.  
- Imagine someone joining the project in 6 months — what would you want them to know?

## 🌍 Why This Matters
Libelle is volunteer-powered and global 🌎.  
We made a space where **a volunteer in Nigeria, a student in Kansas, and a retiree in Raleigh** could all contribute to the same vision.  

These briefs are how we **carry our learning forward** and make sure the wisdom of today becomes the foundation for tomorrow.
